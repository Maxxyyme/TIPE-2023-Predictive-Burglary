# TIPE-2023-Predictive-Burglary
My research work for my TIPE (Personal Initiative Project) as I was studying in CPGE (Two-year classes to prepare for the competitive exams to the french "Grandes Ecoles"). The project is part of the competitve exam.

The project is assessed during an oral exam and received the grade of 12,4/20.

This year's theme was "the city". I decided to show that it is possible to predict the number of burglary in the city of Chicago, using public crime database of Chicago.
